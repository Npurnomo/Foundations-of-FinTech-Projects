    "The one quality of the blockchain technology that is crucial to this problem is transparency. This is due to the series of steps an information is needed to pass so that it can be added to the blockchain. The series of steps includes verification and digital signature. This implies that any false information would not be added to the blockchain as it would fail the verification step. A digital signature is also important so that we will know for sure that the information has not been edited. There are two major ways of verification as a result of the decentralized “trust” mechanism: proof-of-work (POW) and proof-of-stake (POS) algorithms. Both provide incentives for the network to verify each other and add security to the network. In proof-of-work, the “validators” would be awarded coins if they manage to solve a computationally exhausting problem to add a new block. On the other hand, in proof-of-stake, only those with high stakes are allowed to “mine”.\n",

    "Both algorithms also discourage miners to misreport. For POW, the computational costs (electricity, time, etc) are not worth the addition of a new block as the miner would not be awarded coin(s) if the new block is invalid. For POS, the loss of stake if a block is invalid outweighs the benefit of misreporting. This also highlights the assumptions needed. I would assume that the extrinsic costs are higher than the utility gained from misreporting for POW. This is different to that of POS in which I assume that keeping the stake has higher utility that losing the stake (intrinsic costs) and misreporting. The validity of the information is further emphasized by the process of verification by multiple parties. For this, I assume that there are parties in the network that will notice any invalid information/ block."
