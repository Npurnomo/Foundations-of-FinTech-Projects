Assignments for Foundations of FinTech subject (https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2020/subjects/fnce30012) by Nico Purnomo  

Semester 2 2019. Language : Python.

I do not own the datasets for all the projects. 

What I did :

- Exploratory data analysis
- Understanding Blockchain and its application. 
- Participated in a made-up Initial Coin Offering.
- Navigated through a blockchain marketplace: sending requests & creating digital signatures.
- Analysed Robo Advisors and recognised their needs to evaluate users' risk appetite. 
- Used simulation to generate random stocks and bonds portfolios to find the ones with the highest Sharpe Ratio and with the lowest volatility.
- Utilised Tiingo API to integrate financial markets data.
- Analyzed news headlines in relation to stocks returns using NLP.
- Built and train neural network with different layers and different units (neurons) to explain return directions based on financial news.
- Reported and interpreted three performance measures: "Precision", "Recall", and "Accuracy".
- Used the best neural network model to predict future stock returns.
- Compared logit and neural network models to predict probability of default from a set of features provided by Equifax.
